# Marketplace and Quick Start
This is a guide for ISVs to promote their OCI Quick Start to an OCI Marketplace Stack listing.  We're viewing the Quick Start as an incubator for Terraform based OCI Marketplace work.  We hope you choose to publish your Quick Start in the Marketplace as well.

## Contractual Steps
1. [Join Oracle Partner Network (OPN)](https://www.oracle.com/partners/en/partner-with-oracle/get-started/join-opn/index.html) for $500.
2. You'll need to complete the publisher agreement [here](https://go.oracle.com/LP=83217).

## Technical - Register as a Publisher
Sign up to "Become a Publisher" in the upper right of the [Partner Portal](https://cloudmarketplace.oracle.com/marketplace/en_US/partnerLandingPage).  You will need your OPN number.

## Technical - Get an OCI Tenancy
You'll need to sign up for an OCI account to build and test the work.  We're working on a system to provide credits to ISVs we're partnering with to offset the cost here.  Unfortunately, that program is not yet available.

1. Sign up for a trial [here](https://cloud.oracle.com/tryit).
2. Convert the trial to a paid account.
3. Request increases to service limits.  For instance, you might want to request access to GPU instances.

## Next Steps
With all that done, it's probably time for technical onboarding.  We suggest arranging a joint call to walk through that process and work together on publishing.  If you already have a Quick Start, the process will be very lightweight.
